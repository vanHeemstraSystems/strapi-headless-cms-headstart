# 100 - Introduction

In our companion project **[strapi-head-of-cms-headstart](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/strapi-head-of-cms-headstart)** will use have the Graphical User Interface for this Headless Content Management System. 

Updated April 2020

This is the version of the updated hooks of the previous tutorial, written with the class based React

This tutorial will walk you through how to use Next.js (React 16.8 w/ hooks) to power your UI, complete with GraphQL, Stripe, Strapi, and React Context to develop a full-stack application complete with the powerful Strapi (Headless CMS) powering the backend.

Get ready to develop a online food ordering app, more info on the tech stack here: Next.js (React), GraphQL, Stripe and Strapi! From signup to order, you are going to let users discover restaurants, dishes and order meals.

Your app will be complete with user login, registration, authentication, image upload, restaurant creation, dish creation, cart functionality, and stripe order integration.

The demo of the final result should make you hungry:

## Strapi:
Strapi is the most advanced open-source Node.js Headless Content Management System used to build scalable, secure, production ready API's quickly and efficiently saving developers countless hours of development.

With its extensible plugin system, it provides a large set of built-in features: Admin Panel, Authentication & Permissions management, Content Management, API Generator, etc. Unlike an online CMS, Strapi is 100% open-source (take a look at the GitHub repository), which means:

Strapi is completely free.

You can host it on your own servers, so you own the data.
It is entirely customizable and extensible, thanks to the plugin system.

## Next.js:
Next is a lightweight development framework to create server-rendered applications in React. Next.js will take care of the heavy lifting of the application build such as code splitting, HMR (hot module replacement) SSR (server-side rendering) and allow us to focus on writing the code, not our build config. No more configuration and build tinkering.

## React:
React is one of the most popular front-end Javascript frameworks, developed by Facebook and used by countless tech companies including Netflix, Airbnb, and Github to build applications. React is a declarative library that makes it easy to create interactive user interfaces, keeping the code base organized through its component-based architecture.

## GraphQL:
GraphQL is a query language also developed by Facebook to allow the front end of an application to easily query an application's API. Each query requests only the data needed to be rendered by the current view. This allows the developer to craft a great user experience across multiple devices and screen sizes.

## Stripe:
Stripe is one of (if not the largest) payment processors for applications today. Stripe has developed the tools and SDKs to allow developers to craft and integrate secure, compliant payment processing into any app with ease.
